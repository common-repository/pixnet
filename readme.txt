This is a plugin for PIXNET to help user tracking their website and calculate page views.

== Description ==

PIXNET(https://www.pixnet.net/) is an online Taiwanese mobile photo sharing, blogging, and social networking service, started in 2003, that enables its users to store pictures or create blogs and share them either publicly or privately on its website.

This plugin will insert some tracking code in order to calculate page views. To doing this, we will first need to get a unique venue which generate by us via our api so that we can identify which page views are belong to this site.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `pixnet_plugin.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
